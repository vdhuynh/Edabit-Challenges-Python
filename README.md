# Edabit-Challenges-Python
Going through Edabit challenges, making notes to learn and teach more effectively in Python.  (Even obvious notes are put in [for me] to make sure that I am able to better communicate concisely to others [if I am teaching] what is happening and in a way that is accessible and relateable.)  Thanks for reading!
